Hey Panana fam, it’s Mr. Peeltos 🍌here, with some key insights before we roll into the weekend! Let’s dive into what we’ve been working on 🚀

📍 <b>Current State:</b>
You can make predictions without more complex functions like share trading for now. In the given time for the Aptos Code Collision Hackathon, we focused on delivering core functionality—straightforward predictions ⚡

💡 <b>What are Shares?</b>
Shares add flexibility. When you make a prediction, you buy shares in an outcome. If the market moves in your favor, you can sell early and lock in profits—giving you more control! 💼

🎯 <b>What’s Next:</b>
We’re launching on Aptos Mainnet with crypto predictions and an optimized UI integrated with Telegram. After that, we’ll focus on shares for real-world events 🌍🚀

🎉 That’s the update! Have a great weekend from Mr. Peeltos 🍹 Let’s go bananas again next week! 🍌🔥

Jokes aside, the 2024 USA election is already decided. Polymarket called the election in favor of <b>Donald Trump</b> before any media outlet, showing far greater accuracy than pollsters’ 50:50 guesses.
